# mlp-from-scratch
A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron implementation from scratch to perform regression. This MLP consists of one hidden layer with sigmoid activation function. MSE is used for optimization. See [example.ipynb](https://github.com/IamAM99/mlp-from-scratch/blob/main/example.ipynb) to learn how to use the modules.
